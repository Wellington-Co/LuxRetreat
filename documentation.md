**1. Design Choices**

 **Layout**
- **Hero Section**: The homepage features a large hero section with a beautiful background image of the retreat. This makes the site look luxurious right from the start. It also includes a clear call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to explore more.
- **Grid-Based Design**: The main content is organized in a clean grid layout. This helps keep information well-organized and easy to navigate, like showing rooms, services, and booking options.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes. Whether users are on mobile, tablet, or desktop, the experience is smooth and easy to use.

**Colors**
- **Black , Gold and White**: These colors were chosen to give a luxurious and clean feel. Gold represents elegance, while white keeps the design fresh and minimal.


**Typography**
- **Elegant Fonts**: The fonts used are sophisticated and clear, with serif fonts for headings and sans-serif for body text. This combination makes the site look both elegant and easy to read.

**Interactive Elements**
- **Navbar**: The navigation bar blends with the design and becomes a hamburger menu on small screens for easy access. 
- **Hover Effects**: Images change when users hover over them to make the site feel more interactive and engaging.

 **2. Features Implemented Using JavaScript**

 **Form Validation**
- **Contact Form**: The email and message fields are checked to make sure they are filled in correctly before submitting the form. This prevents users from sending invalid or incomplete information.
- **Email Validation**: A simple check makes sure the email is in the right format (e.g., name@example.com).

**Hamburger Menu**
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar changes to a hamburger menu. This helps keep the website neat and easy to use on mobile devices. The menu only appears when users click the hamburger icon.

**Smooth Scrolling and Animations**
- As users scroll down the page, smooth scrolling and animations make the experience more enjoyable and polished.

**Form Submission with External Links**
- The contact form lets users submit messages via WhatsApp or email. When the user clicks the submit button, the message is sent using the chosen platform (WhatsApp or email).

**3. Challenges Faced and Solutions**

**1. Navigation Menu on Small Screens**
- **Challenge**: The navigation menu didn't look good on smaller screens, and the hamburger menu didn't work as expected.
- **Solution**: I used CSS media queries to adjust the layout for small screens. I also added JavaScript to make sure the hamburger menu works properly when clicked.


 **2. Form Submission to WhatsApp and Email**
- **Challenge**: Getting the form to send data to WhatsApp and email wasn't working smoothly across different browsers.
- **Solution**: I added JavaScript to create WhatsApp and email links that work properly when users submit the form. These links open the respective app with the form details automatically.
